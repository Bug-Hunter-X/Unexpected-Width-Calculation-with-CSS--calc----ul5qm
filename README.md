This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function.  The `bug.css` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The problem occurs when calculating widths relative to a container without a defined width.  The solution involves explicitly setting the width of the parent container to ensure the `calc()` function computes the width correctly.
