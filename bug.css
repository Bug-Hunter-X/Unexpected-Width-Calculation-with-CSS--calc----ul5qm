The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  Specifically, the calculation `width: calc(100% - 20px);` is intended to make an element's width 20 pixels less than its container's width. However, if the container's width is not explicitly set, this calculation might not work as expected.  The browser's default width calculation may clash with `calc()`, resulting in unexpected spacing or layout problems.
